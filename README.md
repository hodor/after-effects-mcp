## 📦 Features

### 🎥 Core Composition Features
- **Create compositions** with custom settings (size, frame rate, duration, background color)
- **List all compositions** in a project
- **Get project information** such as frame rate, dimensions, and duration

### 🧱 Layer Management
- **Create text layers** with customizable properties (font, size, color, position)
- **Create shape layers** (rectangle, ellipse, polygon, star) with colors and strokes
- **Create solid/adjustment layers** for backgrounds and effects
- **Modify layer properties** like position, scale, rotation, opacity, and timing

### 🌀 Animation Capabilities
- **Set keyframes** for layer properties (Position, Scale, Rotation, Opacity, etc.)
- **Apply expressions** to layer properties for dynamic animations

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 🛠 Prerequisites
- Adobe After Effects (2022 or later)
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn package manager

### 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dakkshin/after-effects-mcp.git
   cd after-effects-mcp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

4. **Install the After Effects panel**
   ```bash
   npm run install-bridge
   # or
   yarn install-bridge
   ```
   This will copy the necessary scripts to your After Effects installation.

### 🔧 Update MCP Config

Go to your client (eg. Claude or Cursor ) and update your config file

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "AfterEffectsMCP": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\Dakkshin\\after-effects-mcp\\build\\index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### ▶️ Running the Server

1. **Start the MCP server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

2. **Open After Effects**

3. **Open the MCP Bridge Auto panel**
   - In After Effects, go to Window > mcp-bridge-auto.jsx
   - The panel will automatically check for commands every few seconds
   - Make sure the "Auto-run commands" checkbox is enabled

## 🚀 Usage Guide

Once you have the server running and the MCP Bridge panel open in After Effects, you can control After Effects through the MCP protocol. This allows AI assistants or custom applications to send commands to After Effects.

### 📘 Creating Compositions

You can create new compositions with custom settings:
- Name
- Width and height (in pixels)
- Frame rate
- Duration
- Background color

Example MCP tool usage (for developers):
```javascript
mcp_aftereffects_create_composition({
  name: "My Composition", 
  width: 1920, 
  height: 1080, 
  frameRate: 30,
  duration: 10
});
```

### ✍️ Working with Layers

You can create and modify different types of layers:

**Text layers:**
- Set text content, font, size, and color
- Position text anywhere in the composition
- Adjust timing and opacity

**Shape layers:**
- Create rectangles, ellipses, polygons, and stars
- Set fill and stroke colors
- Customize size and position

**Solid layers:**
- Create background colors
- Make adjustment layers for effects

### 🕹 Animation

You can animate layers with:

**Keyframes:**
- Set property values at specific times
- Create motion, scaling, rotation, and opacity changes
- Control the timing of animations

**Expressions:**
- Apply JavaScript expressions to properties
- Create dynamic, procedural animations
- Connect property values to each other
